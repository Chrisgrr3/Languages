# Languages

This Spring Starter Project allows users to create, read, update, and delete languages. The application utilizes a MySQL database and makes use of a service, repository, domain 
model, and a controller for specifying routes that pertain to the CRUD operations. On the primary page ("/languages"), users can view all languages saved in the database along
with information about them. Also on that same page, users can create a new Language and it will automatically be added to the presented list of languages. Users can delete a 
language using the delete action present in the language's row or edit the language by clicking edit. Clicking edit redirects users to a page where they can modify the information
pertaining to the particular language. Finally, users can view a particular language's page by clicking on the name of the language in the table. On this page, the language's
properties are presented, users can redirect to the edit page, users can delete the language and be redirected to the landing page, or users can click "Dashboard" and navigate 
back to the landing page.
