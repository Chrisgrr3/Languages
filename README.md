# Languages

This Spring Starter Project allows users to create, read, update, and delete languages. The application utilizes a MySQL database and makes use of a service, repository, domain 
model, and a controller for specifying routes that pertain to the CRUD operations. On the primary page ("/languages"), users can view all languages saved in the database along
with information about them. Also on that same page, users can create a new Language and it will automatically be added to the presented list of languages. Users can delete a 
language using the delete action present in the language's row or edit the language by clicking edit. Clicking edit redirects users to a page where they can modify the information
pertaining to the particular language.
